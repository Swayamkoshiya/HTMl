• Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?
Ans : In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), tags are used to define the structure and presentation of the content within
a web page. Tags are written as opening and closing pairs enclosed in angle brackets ("<>"), and they surround specific
    parts of the content. For example, the <p> tag is used to define a paragraph, and it is written as
    <p>...</p>, with the actual paragraph content placed between the opening and closing tags.
    On the other hand, HTML elements consist of both the opening and closing tags, along with the content that is
    enclosed within those tags. So, an HTML element is essentially a combination of tags and the content they encompass.
    For instance, the <p> element consists of the opening tag
    <p>, the content and the closing tag </p>.

    • What are tags and attributes in HTML?
    Ans <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    • What are void elements in HTML? With Example.
    Ans <br> - Line Break: The <br> tag is used to insert a line break or a single line space within the content.
    <p>This is the first line.<br>This is the second line.</p>

    • What are HTML Entities? With Example.
    Represents the less than sign (<) character. This entity is used when you want to display the less than sign as part
        of your content without it being interpreted as an opening tag. <p>5 is &lt; 10</p>
        • What are different types of lists in HTML? With Example.
        1.Ordered List (<ol>): An ordered list represents a list of items in a specific order. Each item is numbered
            sequentially by default. The <ol> tag is used to define an ordered list, and each item is defined using the
                <li> (list item) tag
                    Example
                    <ol>
                        <li>First item</li>
                        <li>Second item</li>
                        <li>Third item</li>
                    </ol>
                    First item
                    Second item
                    Third item
                    Unordered List (<ul>): An unordered list represents a list of items without any particular order or
                        sequence. Each item is represented by a bullet point or another custom symbol. The <ul> tag is
                            used to define an unordered list, and each item is defined using the <li> tag.
                                Example
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Red</li>
                                    <li>Green</li>
                                    <li>Blue</li>
                                </ul>

                                • What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? With Example.
                                In HTML, the 'class' attribute is used to assign one or more class names to an element.
                                It allows you to define a class or group for elements that share similar characteristics
                                or styles. The class name can be used to select and target specific elements for CSS
                                styling or JavaScript manipulation.
                                Example
                                <p class="highlight">This is a paragraph with a class</p>
                                • What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML
                                elements? With Example.
                                'id' attribute: The 'id' attribute is used to uniquely identify a specific element on a
                                web page. It should be unique within the entire HTML document, meaning no other element
                                should have the same 'id' value. The 'id' attribute is typically used when you want to
                                target and manipulate a specific element with CSS or JavaScript.

                                Example
                                <p id="my-paragraph">This is a paragraph with an ID</p>

                                • What are the various formatting tags in HTML
                                In HTML, there are various formatting tags available that allow you to apply different
                                types of formatting to the content within your web page. Here are some commonly used
                                formatting tags:
                                <b> - Bold: The <b> tag is used to apply bold formatting to text.
                                        <i> - Italic: The <i> tag is used to apply italic formatting to text.
                                                <u> - Underline: The <u> tag is used to apply underline formatting to
                                                        text.
                                                        <sup> - Superscript: The <sup> tag is used to render text as
                                                                superscript, typically used for mathematical notations,
                                                                footnotes, etc.
                                                                <sub> - Subscript: The <sub> tag is used to render text
                                                                        as subscript, commonly used for chemical
